Description: Performs CACE (Complier Average Causal Effect analysis) on either a single study or meta-analysis of datasets with binary outcomes, using either complete or incomplete noncompliance information. Our package implements the Bayesian methods proposed in Zhou et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/biom.13028>, which introduces a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating CACE in meta-analysis of clinical trials with noncompliance, and Zhou et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1900859>, with an application example on Epidural Analgesia.
